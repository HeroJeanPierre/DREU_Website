		<h2>Week 7</h2>
		<p>This is the week that I switch gears a little bit and make a decision with Dr. Jenkins to switch my project and steer towards the direction of something called ICP.

	<h1>Week 7 Details</h1>
	<h2>What did I do?</h2>
	<p>During this week I really sink my teeth into the concept of ICP. After I drove the robot which utilized ICP, what's my interest into this specific algorithm. Basically I began doing research on this subject on my own and learning what it did and how it did it. I talked to Dr. Jenkins about it and he explain to me what it was. Senate very complicated, because it was, but I was willing to undergo the challenge of learning how to accomplish it.</p>
	<h2>What are the expected challenges?</h2>
	<p>Well, something that is very difficult for me when it comes to this algorithm is that I have not been exposed to a lot of the mathematics involved, part of it has to be learned from the ground up. Benefit Concepts that are required in order for ICP to work deal with someone Advanced linear algebra topics that I haven't covered before, I imagine I will be spending a large chunk of my time simply grasping these concepts. But I am always willing to learn.</p>
