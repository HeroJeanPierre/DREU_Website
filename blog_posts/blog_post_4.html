		<h2>Week 4: Learning Web Basics</h2>
		<p>So, this is the week that I decided that I would learn how to construct a website. There are a lot of reasons that I wanted to be able to do this, only one of which was to create this website specifically. Basically, whenever I would have a spare moment I would turn towards w3schools.com and learn as much as I could.</p>

		<h1>Week 4 Details</h1>
		<p>I constructed this entire web page from scratch. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all the product of what I have learned thus far. There is still a lot left to learn, but it is nice to know that I can build this much without any help (if you don't count JavaScript libraries as help)</p>

		<h2>Why did I decide to do this?</h2>
		<p>Apart from this site, I wanted to be able to create cohesive front end sites. This is tied to what I plan on doing in the lab partially. There was a deficit of front end devs in the lab and some of the tools that we are going to build require them. Also, Dr. Jenkins urged we acquire the skills to build our own websites.</p>
		<h2>How Did I Learn It?</h2>
		<p>A lot of time and practice. I didn't spend any time taking notes, I just went straight into applying what I learned into a mock web site. That I will link to this page soon.</p>
		<p>The new method that I used to learn HTML and JavaScript was using w3schools.com, they have plenty of good tutorials on how to implement HTML CSS and JavaScript. And I learn these from the ground up, what is a good experience in the culmination of my knowledge can be found in the workmanship of this website which I built from scratch with no templates.</p>
