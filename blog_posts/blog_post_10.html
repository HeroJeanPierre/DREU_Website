		<h2>Learning About the Grad Program</h2>
		<p>
		After I did my presentation, I visited some of the different labs for classes that were taught to graduate students who were pursuing a masters in robotics. I also met with some of the advisors and got their recommendations on what to do if you're applying to grad school for the University of Michigan. It was a very informative experience and I am glad that I had it.</p>
