		<h2>Week 2</h2>
		<p>This is the were I begin to get my hands a little dirty. I decided that the project that I want to get involved in deals with object detection. We wanted to know if the current Neural Net could be outperformed by a Support Vector Machine. Both of those are methods to classify images (or anything really).</p>

		<p>This is just a little example of how objects are detected with images. Typically a bounding box surrounds the object of interest. Though, we were not dealing with people, we were actually dealing with chairs.</p>

		<h1>Week 2 Details</h1>
		<p>During the second week I worked with my partner Tyler, order to solve the problem that was given to us. The test that I was assigned was the job of creating a small program that simplify the process of designating correctly categorized photos versus categorize photos. Like I mentioned in the previous week I have decided to work on a project that deals with a computer learning algorithm called a Support Vector Machine. </p>
		<p>
		In this week I learned and accomplished a lot and was able to cover a lot of ground with respect to the algorithm. What are the key things that I accomplished was finishing the aforementioned programmed, after I finish the program I uploaded it to the gitlab hosted by the lab. This shared it with all of my peers within the lab.</p>
