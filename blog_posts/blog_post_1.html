		<h1>Week 1 Details</h1>
		<p>The first thing that we did was introduce ourselves to the other interns. There are about eight other interns that I am working with, which have an interest in computer science or mechanical engineering. This makes sense because it's a robotics lab. Next, we met the grad students, when we were introduced to a lot of the products that they're working on, any of these projects we're open for us to work on as well. After the projects were discussed, we're able to see a demo of the main robot that was being used in the lab. The demo consisted of the "Fetch," robot picking up objects from a desk.</p>
		<p>Very similar to this video (Except it was only one video):</p>

		<p>Throughout the week I spent a lot of time determining what I wanted to work on as a full-time project. I wanted to work on something that had relevance to Machine Learning because that was my field of Interest. Film any of the implementations for the Fetch robot included machine learning algorithms, not a lot of them needed improvement.</p>

		<p>However, near the end of the week, one of the grad students presented an idea that they needed help on that required machine learning, her name was Jen. I and another grad student last onto this idea and chose it as our project. I will talk more about this idea in the next week because
