		<h2>Week 5: I Learn Three.js and Other Web Tools</h2>
		<p>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js">Three.js</a>? It is a JavaScript library that utilizes WebGL to allow you to create 3D visualization like this:</p>
		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<canvas id="canvas_1" style="position: relative; top: .4em; right: 1em"></canvas>
			<script src="../scripts/cube_1.js"></script>
		</div>
		<p>I spent a good amount of time becoming familiar with the language in hopes to use it with a project with the robots down the line.</p>

		<h2>What is Three.js?</h2>

		<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library Taylor towards creating three-dimensional using WebGL. It is a very simple way to render 3D objects onto the screen, this is an essential part of my research because in order to map out three-dimensional environment, first need a fundamental understanding of how to place 3D objects into a two-dimensional. Dr. Jenkins recommended that I learn this in order to have a good foundation when it comes to moving onto higher level computer vision problems. </p>

		<p>Overall I had a lot of fun learning through to yes and I would say that it was a successful week. I was able to create many different types of objects and environments within the three-dimensional space provided by Three.js.</p>
