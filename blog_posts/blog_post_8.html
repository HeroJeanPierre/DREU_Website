		<h2>Week 8</h2>
		<p>During this week I decided to talk to some of my peers about ICP. I learned a lot better when I can hear the concepts from other people who have already understood the fundamentals of it. This is what I spent doing this week.</p>

		<h1>Week 8 Details</h1>
		<p>One of the interns that I turn to learn from was named Tommy. Hw was very knowledgeable on the subject of ICP. He should have lot of the ideas that he had with it because he had already implemented it into a robot last summer. He even shared some of the code that he used in order to accomplish the implementation, so the code wasn't that helpful because it wasn't, too well, I do not blame him since she never expected to show this code to anyone. Nonetheless it was helpful.
		I suspect one of the older interns Matt who is there a temporarily for just about a week. We had whiteboard time and discuss the topic of ICP in death he also explained GICP, which stands for generalized iterative closest point, something that we won't get into right now. </p>
		<h2>What did I do with there insights?
		</h2>
		<p>I took what they had to say, in created it into my code, and it turned out to work pretty well. The only problem was that I had not yet master the mathematical necessary in order to make it work completely. The big struggle for me, but I kept at it</p>
