		<h1>Week 9 Details</h1>
		<h2>What Did I Read?</h2>
		<p>The main paper I read was on the subject of using least-squares to fits two three dimensional Point sets. The paper is titled Least-Squares Fitting of Two 3-D Point Sets, and can be found <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4767965/">here</a>. </p>

		<h2>How did it go?</h2>
		<p>It was fine initially, but what was still over my head, and turn the first time that I've read this paper. It was only the first time that I had taken it very very seriously and said to myself that I would finally understand the concept that was mentioned in the paper. It took a long time and a lot of re-reading in order for me to grasp the concepts at a reasonable level. But implementing it was a completely different monster. Which I was able to tackle with some success in the coming weekend and days following before presentations.</p>
