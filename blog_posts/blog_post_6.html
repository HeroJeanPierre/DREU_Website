		<h2>Week 6</h2>
		<p>Happy 4th! It was my birthday this week and I celebrated with cake and robots. This week I went over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point">Iterative Closest Point</a> algorithm. This is an algorithm that helps robots navigate through their environment without getting lost.</p>

		<p>This is a robot in the lab that uses ICP to help navigate. I spent a lot of time controlling the robot and understanding how this robot in particular navigates.</p>
