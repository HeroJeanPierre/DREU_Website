		<h2>Week 6</h2>
		<p>Happy 4th! It was my birthday this week and I celebrated with cake and robots. This week I went over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point">Iterative Closest Point</a> algorithm. This is an algorithm that helps robots navigate through their environment without getting lost.</p>

		<p>This is a robot in the lab that uses ICP to help navigate. I spent a lot of time controlling the robot and understanding how this robot in particular navigates.</p>

		<h1>Week 6 Details</h1>
		<p>This was the week that I was introduced to an algorithm with the acronym of ICP, what stands for iterative closest point. Basically this is an algorithm that robots use in order to determine the translation and rotation from their previous point in space. This is essential when it comes to taking in large point Cloud multiple times a second, a robot moves slightly the next Point Clyde will be a little bit different, and it is important to understand how the robot moved in relation to the last point cloud gathered. That is basically what ICP job is. In the image above you can see a robot that has laser range finder on the top, this is what is used to pick up the point clouds from the environment. After the point clouds are gathered ICP is ran, and helps the robot update its position in the environment. </p>

		It was actually a lot of fun driving this robot around, in being able to see what the robots are through its laser range finder with my colleagues help. It was one of the highlights of my summer and really got me interested in developing software that helped these sort of robots move through an environment</p>
