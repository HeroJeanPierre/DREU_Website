		<h2>Week 3: More on SVM's (And a little JavaScript)</h2>
		<p>This week I continued my work with Tyler on to determine if using an SVM is a viable competitor  to a Neural Network when it comes to classifying chairs. Also, I worked on a small program in JavaScript that Dr. Jenkins recommended I create.</p>

		<h1>Week 3 Details</h1>
		<p>The program that I was told to develop was one that was able to create a least square regression line using a method called pseudo-inverse.</p>
		<p>I decided to use a graphical library called p5.js for the visuals, and numeric.js for the linear algebra. This was the result. Click anywhere to add dots, and increase the order of the equation of best fit using the "Order +" button.</p>
